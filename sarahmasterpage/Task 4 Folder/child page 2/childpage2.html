<h1>Why Humans Can Be Color Blind</h1>
<a href="../Task4PrimaryPage.html"> link to homepage</a>
<p>The human eyes sees using cones and rods. The cones in your eyes are the reason that we can see in color. The more or
less cones an organism has is responsible for the amount of color that they can see. Rods are the reason that we can see 
in the dark. They are the reason that we can have night vision or how cirtain animals see better in the dark than others.</p>

<p>The cones work by sensing light waves. When they detect a cirtain wavelength it will send a signal to the brain 
and the brain interprets the signals.</p>
<ol>The reason that people can be colorblind is because of 3 reasons</ol>
<li>they're born with less cones than usual</li>
<li>Their red or green color cones are damaged</li>
<li>Their brain misenterprets the signals that their eyes give(most unusual)</li>
</ol>
