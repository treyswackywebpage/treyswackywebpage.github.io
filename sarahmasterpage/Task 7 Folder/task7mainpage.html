<p><a href="../mainpage.html">Link to Mainpage</a></p>

<p>Colors cause people to feel certain things.
<br> They can make us feel sad or happy or angry
for no other reason than the color.</p>

<p>Our <a class="purple" href="dp1/dp1task7.html">brain </a>enterprets the different wavelengths of light
<br>as colors. The rays of light go through our cornea and into 
<br>the color cones inside our eyes. The cones send signals 
<br>to our brain that it interprets as colors.<br>
Becasue our brain uses chemicals to 'see' the world
<br> around us then color can make us feel in different
<br>ways.<br> <a href="dp1/dp1task7.html"> Link to See Color Charts</a>
</p>
<br>
<p>The reason that our brains interpret colors with a mood and feeling
<br>is because of hormones and chemicals. When you brain recieves the 
<br>sensors from the color cones it releases chemicals to create
<br> the image that you see. The chemicals that it releases are
<br>directally connected to you mood. Humans interpret yellow 
<br>as a happy color because when it recieves the sensor for yellow
<br> your brain releases seratonin- one of the key chemicals in happiness.
