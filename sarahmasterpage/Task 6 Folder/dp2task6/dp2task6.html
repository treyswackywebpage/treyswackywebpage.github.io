<h4 class="sup"> Eye Color Alleles</h4>
<p>The way that the genetics of eye color work is that
the dominate trait show above the recessive. <br>Like how if a child has one brown eyed
parent and one blue eyed the child is most likely to have brown eyes because 
it is a dominate trait about blue.<br> Although with different traits and alleles it
is possible for the brwon eyed parent to be heterozygous(i.e. one brown eyed trait
and one blue eyed trait) then<br> their is a small chance of the child having blue eyes.</p>

<h4 class="sup"> Mendelian Charts</h4>
<p>The way that we can track and predict the eye color of a child is using a mendelian chart.<br>
The parents alleles are placed on the sides of the chart and they are crossed together. To predict<br>
the chance/percentage of children that might have certain eye colors.<br>
There are more than one trait that goes into eye color so in real life the actual chart is much larger than
this example.</p>
