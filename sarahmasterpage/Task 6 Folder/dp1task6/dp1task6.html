<h4 class="sup">Eye Colors Around the World</h4>
<p>Eye color is one of the main ways that people will identity each other.<br>
While we are told that there is a wide range of eye colors, they are shown<br>
in only a few rare cases. Every color exept for brown that we see in eyes has <br>
come from a genetic mutation many years ago. Brown eyes are the most common <br>
and are the only color that has not mutated. Brown eyes make up more than 50% of <br>
all eye colors.</p>

<h4 class="sup">Eye Colors in Books</h4>
<p>While in reality the range of colors is less than expected. It is even less varied<br>
in books and movies. For the world brown eyes are over 50% of the population, but in<br>
books blue eyes are the most commonly mentioned at 52% dispite only making up 8% of the world population.</p>
