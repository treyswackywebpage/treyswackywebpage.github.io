<h1>Crispy CSS</h1>
<br>
<img src="sup1.jpg" height=300 width=400>
<p>This is useful because you don't have to link to other pages. You
also can just scroll up and fix an issue. You dont have to come up with weird names becasue
of how many things you want to change in different pages. The page CSS can be specialized
for only that page.
</p>
<img src="sup2.jpg" height=300 width=400>
<p>
This is useful becasue you only have to have one file for all of your
CSS code. Also you can have multiple pages with the same format
because they have the same CSS tags and you dont have to re-write the
code more than once.
</p>
<p>
Why did this make me cry?
<ol>
<li>It is very complicated</li>
<li>The names get weird and it is hard to come up with new names</li>
<li>It makes more pages needed and more work to file</li>
<li>There has to be more links that are adressed correctly</li>
</ol>

<h1>Jalopy Javascript</h1>
<br>
<img src="sup3.jpg" height=300 width=400>
<p>This allows you to change text with a click of a button. Yet it isn't nearly as fun
as i make it sound. Overal though it was the best and most fun of all of the tasks
because it makes logical sense and I can see myself actually using the form
in the future and that it isn't only useful in this class. You know what I want
to make these collums somewhat similar so ima add in a photo of my actual task 5.</p>
<img src="sup6.jpg" height=300 width=400>
<p>
Tada I added it and this makes the chart look a lot better but I just need to 
ramble for a few more lines until they match.
</p>
<p>
Why did this make me cry?
<ol>
<li>It is basically useless unless my future job is a mad lib maker that is solely online</li>
<li>It is overly complicated</li>
<li>If one thing is messed up the entire thing will not work</li>
<li>I had to completely re-write it twice</li>
</ol>

<h1>Flunky Forms</h1>
<br>
<img src="sup4.JPG" height=300 width=400>
<p>This is the code for the form</p>
<img src="sup5.jpg" height=300 width=400>
<p> This is the end result</p>
<p>Now I essentially have to ramble until the texts align because the website has to
have visual appeal. Adam is duh bestttt I dont think nyone else is going to see this
but oh well. I like the color blue I like the color red. Hopefully this will be enough to fix the unbalance
of the spacings. Yet it is not enough why wount this work and the css wont fix it no matter how hard i try.
</p>
<p>
Why did this make me cry?
<ol>
<li>Its usually combine with javascript(at least in this class)</li>
<li>It is slightly boring</li>
<li>It makes the usual set up of html look weird and like you are doing it wrong.</li>
</ol>
