This is esentially all anyone needs to know to create the basic webpage.<br>
It wont make the page look super cool but it will get the job done<br>
quick and easy. This is the ideal thing and is what I used for about the first 4<br>
tasks that Dr.Wilson gave me before i started to get confused and not understand.<br>
Yayy ive prolly written enought for this to count now! Hopefully.<br>

For the css it wasnt that complicated. It is useful becasue now i can change the format of what<br>
ever i want and not have to worrry about anything not looking bad. The task that was on<br>
a seperate document task 6 i think was useless and overly complicated. It <br>
was the worst one we've had to do so far but it is probably the most useful.

I wonder if you are actually going to take the time to read all that im taking<br>
the time to write or if all my work is completely usless and<br>
worthless to you. Prolly. I wonder if you are going to even know what i am typing<br>
saying that this is not the first or last paragraph that is the<br>
same size and format as all the others.<br>

By now hopefully ive told you or you have figured out that these all go to the <br>
exact same place because you didnt say that i had to write more<br>
than two daughter pages. It always says "non random text" but this is fairly<br>
weird cause im rambling but hey rambling is not always random. Plus i actually <br>
took the time to write all of this out. Hey i could use this as a blog!<br>
Oh nvm my life isnt that bloggable.

Mushy Mainpage<br>

Ha its funny how i actually tried on the very first two and that my definitions are<br>
quickly getting worse. Blogger time. Today i forgot my entire backpack at home.<br>
Luckily not a single thing about my day has changed. I didn't have any missing asignments<br>
and almost no one noticed until i told them. Its kinda sad i remebered to bring starbucks <br>
but not to bring my actual bag to school. Oh welll no regrets.
