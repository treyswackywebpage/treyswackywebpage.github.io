        <p>Fortnite is a game which has been debated over the last few centuries on whether or not it should remain in the grasp of younger children. Children have been known to overuse the game and it has resulted in bullying and abuse on the game's online voice chat system. The system has been heavily critized on if it should be removed due to other programs willing to complete the same task but also include less abuse. Vbucks have remained the in game currency and younger children have been known to acquire their parents credit cards and buy the online currency without knowledge of their parents. </p>
