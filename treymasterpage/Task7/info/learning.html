		<p>To create webpages first you have to know what you're doing.<br><z onclick="location.href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development'" class="hidden">Web Development</z> is a job involving developing a website or intranet. [1] Web development can vary from developing simple text pages to complex web applications (web applications), e-commerce, and social networking services. It may include the most popular list of website development, web technology, web design, web content development, client access, client / server scanning, network security settings, development. Web server and e-commerce.

Among online experts, "web development" often refers to the main features of web pages that are not formatted: scripting and coding. [2] Web development can use the Content Management System (CMS) to easily change content and accessibility with basic technical skills.

For large companies and businesses, web development teams can design hundreds of people (web developers) and follow standard methods, such as flexible website development methods. Smaller organizations may only require a developer or operator or secondary allocation for related work, such as a graphic designer or IT engineer. Web development can be an interdisciplinary collaboration and not a specific job. Web developers have three different specializations: the previous developer, the backend developer and the complete developer. A developer of applications dedicated to the user, responsible for the actions and images executed in the user's browser, while the server is responsible for the backend developers.

Online marketing has become a growing industry. Industry-based growth companies want to use their website to promote and sell products and services to customers. [3]

There are many open source web development tools like Berkeley DB, GlassFish, LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) and Perl / Plack. This has reduced the cost of learning from network development to a minimum. Other factors affecting industrial growth include: Adding easy-to-use WYSIWYG web development programs, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Microsoft Visual Studio. You still have to learn the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) or programming language to use those programs, but the basics can be learned quickly and done.

More and more tools and technologies have helped developers create more dynamic and interactive websites. In addition, web developers are currently helping to create applications, such as web services, that are usually only available as desktop applications. This has provided many opportunities for information decentralization and media distribution. See examples of advanced cloud services like Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox and Google Drive. These network services allow users to interact with multiple applications instead of linking to a specific workstation because of their application environment.

Examples include drastic changes in communication and business, driven by e-commerce in web development. Internet auction sites, like eBay, have changed the way consumers find and buy products and services. Online merchants like Amazon.com and Buy.com (among others) have switched to buying and negotiating with many consumers. Another example of site-oriented communication is blogging. Web applications like WordPress and Movable Type create web environments for individual websites. Expanding the use of open source content management systems and content management systems within the company has expanded the impact of web development on online interaction and communication.</p>
