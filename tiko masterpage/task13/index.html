        <h1>So this is supposed to be outside of the gray box</h1>
        <p>My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section
           of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee
           for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest.
            I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get
             eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing
              about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems
               sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress
                in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying
                 to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care
                  not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would
                   cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know
                    that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose
                     to anyone.</p>
