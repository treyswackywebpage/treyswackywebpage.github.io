        <h1>My Poem About Napoleon</h1>
        <hr> 
        <p><b>Napoleon Bonaparte</b> was a great little man</p>
        <p><b>A</b> battle he lost was <b>Trafalgar</b></p>
        <p><b>P</b>oor Napoleon how much he did lose</p>
        <p><b>O</b>h poor Napoleon at <b>Waterloo</b> too</p>
        <p><b>L</b>ater about that but before then</p>
        <p><b>E</b>veryone with him the <b>government they overthrew</b></p>
        <p><b>O</b>h how when you reached <b>Moscow</b> everything was burned</p>
        <p><b>N</b>ow you must retreat, for food they yearned</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Borodino</b>  thou didst barely complete</p>
        <p><b>O</b>h your success with the <b>plebicite</b></p>
        <p><b>N</b>ow you can reign emperor from your height</p>
        <p><b>A</b>n advance from brittain made you close many ports</p>
        <p><b>P</b>erhaps this will settle the feud.</p>
        <p><b>A</b>h but it did not, as the <b>Continental system</b> did retort</p>
        <p><b>R</b>ight, as thou has been exiled once to <b>Elba</b></p>
        <p><b>T</b>hou wast exiled again to <b>St. Helena</b>.</p>
        <p><b>E</b>verday, thou wilst be remembered!</p>
