	<p class="speech">Thank you, thank you all so very much. Thank you to The Classical Academy, thank you to all of you in this room. I have to congratulate the other incredible webpages this year for their unbelievable performances.
	<br><br>Task 13 was a product of the tireless efforts of an unbelievable cast and crew I got to work alongside. First off to my brother in this endeavor, Mr. Tiko Bauer. Tiko, your fierce talent on-screen can only be surpassed by your friendship off-screen.
	<br><br>To Mr. Trey Deabueno, as the history of web programming unfolds, you have forged your way into history these past two years. What an unbelievable talent you are. Thank you to you and Cirno for creating a transcendent programmic experience for all of us.
	<br><br>Thank you to everybody at France and New Zealand, in particular Number 16 Bus Shelter. You were the champion of this endeavor. My entire team. I have to thank everyone from the very onset of my career. Dr. Wilson for forcing me in my first webpage. Dr. Wilson for teaching me so much about the programming art form. To Dr. Wilson, thank you for helping me navigate my way through this industry. And to my parents, none of this would be possible without you. And to my friends, I love you dearly, you know who you are.
	<br><br>And lastly, I just want to say this: Making Task 13 was about man’s relationship to the digital world, a world that we collectively felt in 2015 as the hottest year in recorded history(until 2018). Our production needed to move to the southern tip of this planet just to be able to find snow. Climate change is real. It is happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species, and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating.
	<br><br>We need to support leaders around the world who do not speak for the big polluters or the big corporations, but who speak for all of humanity, for the indigenous people of the world, for the billions and billions of underprivileged people who will be most affected by this, for our children’s children, and for those people out there whose voices have been drowned out by the politics of greed.
	<br><br>I thank you all for this amazing award tonight. Let us not take this planet for granted. I do not take tonight for granted. Thank you so very much.
