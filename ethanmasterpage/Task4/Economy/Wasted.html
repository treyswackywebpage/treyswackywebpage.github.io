The penny is a problem for the economy of the United States of America. A penny was made up of ninety-five percent
copper and five percent zinc in the 1900s, but now the penny is made mostly of zinc coated in copper.
The cost of making the penny has risen to $0.015 meaning the $0.01 penny costs more to make than it is worth.
This costs the United States of America millions of dollars as billions of pennies are made over the years
leaving a dent in our economy. This inflation will be the end of the economy of the United States of America
and will cause anarchy because of the increasing price of the production of the penny. The penny should be removed
entirely from the currency of the United States of America and all copper and zinc should be melted and sold
to make up for the production costs of the penny in the United States of America. As Americans
we must stand up for ourselves and outlaw the penny that has sapped our tax dollars away from the military to
be used in the production of useless and expensive copper plated zinc discs that were declared as a monetary
system three centuries ago by our founding fathers. Thank you for reading my blog and God bless America!
